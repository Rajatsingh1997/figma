                  Some days a motivational quote can provide a quick pick-me-up

                  entrepreneur with a new business idea, landing investors and
                  launching your business can pose a paradoxical “chicken and

                  Many companies use crowdfunding campaigns to bring novel
                  concepts to market, raising small amounts of capital from a
                  vast number of individuals online. Take virtual reality
                  company Oculus VR as an example, which started with
                  crowdfunding and was later purchased by Facebook for $2
                  billion.

                  Mark Campbell, who is an Advisor in The Oracles, has seen
                  hundreds of entrepreneurs and inventors attain anywhere from
                  $50,000 to more than $1 million for their business ideas this
                  way. As vice president of marketing for crowdfunding launch
                  program InventureX, Campbell has greenlit projects ranging
                  from electric bicycles to science experiments.

                  “Crowdfunding is a great way to test a novel idea, prove a
                  concept, and win investors,” he says. So, how do you take a
                  new business idea, achieve massive exposure, and exceed your
                  financing goals? From the mind of a crowdfunding connoisseur,
                  here are five steps to manifesting your million-dollar idea
                  and transforming it into a profitable business.{" "}

                  1. Determine if crowdfunding makes sense for you.

                  “First, figure out if crowdfunding is even right for your
                  idea,” shares Campbell. “An idea can be crowdfunded if it
                  provides value to a specific community and if you can offer an
                  incentive or reward to that audience online. It has to check
                  both boxes.”

                <h4 className="mb-4 mt-4 tap">2. Multiply your goals.</h4>
                <p className="mt-4 para">
                  To maximize returns for your campaign, envision what a
                  successful one looks like from the onset. While getting
                  funding is important, don’t stop there. You can accomplish
                  more than just financial goals with crowdfunding, so don’t
                  limit yourself.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4 para">
                  “Identify a few objectives in addition to raising funds,” says
                  Campbell. “It may be exposure or proving the concept before
                  you invest your whole life savings into it. For example, we’re
                  seeing lots of foreign companies use crowdfunding to test
                  their product through a soft launch before entering the U.S.
                  market. By releasing their product to a sample audience, they
                  can test and improve it before launching it full-scale.”

                  3. Provide value to your supporters.
                </h4>
                <p className="mt-4 para">
                  Every successful campaign hinges on audience participation.
                  Once you identify your target audience, decide what will
                  incentivize them to invest in you. According to Campbell,
                  there are two kinds of incentives: “There’s the traditional
                  rewards-based model, and there's equity crowdfunding, which is
                  like a mini IPO — you’re offering ownership.”

                <h4 className="mt-4 tap">
                  4. Create a project page and promotional video.{" "}
                </h4>
                <p className="mt-4 para">
                  The next step is to decide which platform is best for hosting
                  your project. Hosting sites like Indiegogo, Kickstarter, and
                  GoFundMe each have their own policies. “Carefully review the
                  rules of each site,” warns Campbell. “On sites like
                  Kickstarter, you keep 100 percent ownership of your work, but
                  you won’t see a penny if you don’t meet your goal by deadline
                  -- even if you’re 80 percent funded.” It’s key to weigh the
                  benefits and drawbacks of each platform. With crowdfunding,
                  you reach myriad investors from one site: your project page.
                  As your sole point of contact with potential investors, it has
                  to be high caliber. According to Campbell, the most critical
                  element is the promotional video. “A great video clearly and
                  succinctly tells your story, presents your value, and
                  emotionally connects with the audience.” The ideal video
                  should be no longer than three minutes.

                <p className="mt-4 para">
                  The more exposure for your campaign, the better. “Lock in a
                  marketing plan before you launch, be it promoting your product
                  to specific online communities or advertising to drive traffic
                  to your page,” shares Campbell. He says effective marketing
                  plans typically include Facebook advertising, PR outreach to
                  media, social media promotions, and influencer marketing.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4 para">
                  Campbell recommends finding a marketing partner who’s as
                  invested in your success as you are. Look for people who are
                  highly regarded in crowdfunding marketing and demonstrate
                  their expertise every day. “You want a partner who
                  specifically knows crowdfunding and how to position your
                  project so people share it.”
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4 para">
                  Once you’re off the ground, use the momentum to build your
                  business. Campbell recommends thinking big about your brand
                  and how to scale it. “Some next-level strategies are creating
                  an e-commerce store, securing more financing, and getting into
                  big-box stores.”

                <p className="mt-4 para">
                  A well-executed crowdfunding campaign can transform young
                  businesses. “We're on the cutting edge of entrepreneurship. I
                  never know what big idea is going to walk through the door
                  next.”
